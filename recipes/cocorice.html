        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a restaurant style creamy coconut rice which is very simple and cheap to make. 
            The sugar in the recipe adds a complexity to the taste. The washing and soaking of the rice results in a
            fluffy texture for the finished coconut rice.
